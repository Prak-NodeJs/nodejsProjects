//     Nodejs

// 1. what is nodejs
// Node.js is an open - source, cross - platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code server - side.It is built on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine, which is the same engine that powers the Google Chrome browser.Node.js enables the use of JavaScript for server - side scripting, allowing developers to create scalable and high - performance web applications.


// 2. what is runtime
// A runtime environment is a software framework that provides the necessary resources for executing and running programs or applications.It includes components such as libraries, APIs(Application Programming Interfaces), and other essential tools that enable the execution of code written in a specific programming language.The runtime environment plays a crucial role in managing the execution of a program by providing the necessary services and support during runtime.

// 3. what is event driven
// In Node.js, being event - driven means that the execution of your code is triggered by events, and the flow of the program is determined by these events rather than a linear sequence of statements.This is facilitated by the event loop, a core concept in Node.js that allows it to handle many connections simultaneously while remaining non - blocking.
//     Node.js is event - driven because it allows you to define functions(callbacks) that will be executed in response to specific events(such as file reading completion, incoming HTTP requests, etc.), allowing for non - blocking and efficient handling of multiple tasks simultaneously.


// 3.what is middleware
// what is bodyparser
// what is promises, give one example,
//     what is async await, asyanc parallel and async soemthing
// what is event driven, single threaded,
//     difference between promises and promise all
// what is callback, with one example
// why to use nodejs
// what jwt, algorithm is used, default expire time,
//     some question on settimeout, function
//         how to handle unhandle exception in nodejs with example
// what is emitter in nodejs
// what is streams with one exmaple
// what is difference between dev dependencies and simple dependicies,
//     what is asynchronous,
//         how nodejs work
// what does package.json contains,
//     what is docker, what is image
// how to use jest for test cases
// concept of es6,
//     difference between spread and rest operator with one exmaple
// what do you mean by error first callback with example.
//     call, await
// what call bind













// 1. why nodejs is single threaded ?

//     nodejs works on single threade model to support the asynchronous processing which provide high performance and efficiency to its applications under high amount of load

// 2. How nodejs can execute code in backedn ?
//     nodejs use chrome's v8 engine to execute code in backend

// 3.nodejs is made by which languages ?
//     nodejs is made of c, c++ and javascript

// 4. what is difference between javascript and nodejs
//  javascript can not connect to database but node can,
//     javascript can't run outside the brower and node can

// 5. what is npm
// it is node package manager, it is used to manage all the installed packages.


// 6. difference between == and === in nodejs ?
// == will compare between only values but === will compare between values and data types


// 7. what is work of filter funtion in nodes ?
//     filter is used to filter out specific element from an array.


// 8. in nodejs what http module does?
// in nodejs http module handles the request and response of server.

// 9. why to use express js, over nodejs http ?



//     10. what is useStrickt



// 11. in nodejs what do you mean by rest api
// rest stands for reprententional state transfer, it is set of rules or guidelines that help us to create webservices that can be easily cosumed by other applications,

//     let me simplify it, whenever you making request to any rest api, you are telling which data and in which format  you want, then rest api retreives that data from database or from other soruce and send it you in json format


// 12. different nodjes frameworks,
//     express.js, meter.js, nestjs, sails, js kao.js, hapi.js

// 13. difference between single threaded or multi threaded ?
// ..single threaded runs one command at a time but multi threaded can run more than one at a time.


// 14. what is docker
// docker is a tool that allows you to package and run software applications in a standarized way.
// it works by creating isolated containers that applications needs to run such as code, libraries, and dependencies









// React

// react is javascript libraru maintained by facebook and it is used to develop single page applications.

// 2. what do u mean by single page application

// it means without performing page reload we can switch between webpages.

// 3. why react is fast.

// react uses virtual DOM which updates only required component of a web page instead of the whole web page.

// 4. which apps uses reactjs
// netflix, whatsapp web, instagram, airbnb etc.

// 5. what is component in react ?
//     a component is set of code tht can be reused

// 6. types of components
// two types, functional and class components,

// 7. what is jsx
// javascript extensible markup langauge, it is the combination of javascript and html tags.

// 8.
